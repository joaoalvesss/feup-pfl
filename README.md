## Game Parameters

### Game Introduction
Bounce is a two-player game designed by Mark Steere in August 2023. It is played on a square board of any even size. The objective of the game is to strategically move your checkers to form a monocolored, orthogonally interconnected group.

### Game Board
The game board is a square grid of any even size. It is initially filled with a checkerboard pattern of red and blue checkers, except for the corner squares, which remain unoccupied.

### Objective
The primary objective in Bounce is to ensure that, at the conclusion of your turn, all of your checkers are part of a single group. Achieving this goal leads to victory.

### Game Play
- The game begins with Red making the first move.
- Players take turns moving one of their checkers to an unoccupied square if a legal move is available.
- The checker you move must become part of a larger group after your move compared to its previous group size.

### Checker Removal
If you have no legal moves available on your turn, you must instead remove one of your checkers from the board. This concludes your turn.
